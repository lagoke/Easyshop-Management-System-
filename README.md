# Overview

This sofftware project aims to build a Mini Shop Retail Application (More like a Point of Sales application) which is used to capture the quantity of snacks and drinks a customer bought, considers if it has to be delivered at home and also decide if it will be taxed or not. The total cost is calculated automatically when the total button is punched. The receipt is also generated. There is a calculator to double check the calculation, if need be. There is also a currency converter to convert from one currency to the other.

The Mini Shop Management System is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application that has 6 sections.
- The section accepting the quantity of snacks and drinks with check box for Home delivery and Tax
- The section displaying the cost of snacks, drinks and delivery
- The section for Currency converter
- The section for Tax, Sub Total and Total
- The section that has 2 tabs for standard Calculator and receipt
- The final section at the buttom of the screen where the Total, Receipt, Reset, Open Record and Exit buttons are displayed.

The sole purpose of writing this application is to demonstrate the application of my new-found knowledge of Java programming language by building an application that will fulfill the requirements as specified in the acoompanying module for this week's sprint.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools I used to develop this Easy Shop Management System are: JDK (Java Development Kit) and Netbeans (an IDE)

The programming language I used to write the application is Java

# Future Work
- I intend to have a database that will keep the record of the sales of snacks and drinks instead of a text file
- I intend to have the list of snacks to be edited from a dashboard from the back-end
- I intend to have the prices controlled from back-end rather than have them fixed.
- I would like to have the current values of the currencies displayed as real-time values obtained from some kind of a foreign exchanged platform through the use of an API.
